## Resources I Used

The font used in my site banner is Jacquard 24 by Sarah Cadigan-Fried. It is provided under the Open Font License. Sarah has made several ornamental pixel-type fonts, which, interestingly enough, are actually designed for knitting. They are all available on her GitHub profile linked below:

- [Sarah Cadigan-Fried's GitHub profile](https://github.com/scfried)
- [License for Jacquard](/Jacquard_24/OFL.txt)
- [The repository for Jacquard on GitHub](https://github.com/scfried/soft-type-jacquard)

For the patterned backgrounds on this site I have used [heropatterns.com](https://heropatterns.com) by Steve Schoger, a very cool resource for customizable, SVG-based repeating patterns. They are provided under a Creative Commons attribution license.

## Building this Site

This site is built using Hugo, billed as a fast and flexible static-site generator (SSG) written in Go. You can learn more about Hugo at [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io). My Hugo theme is adapted from [lugo](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lugo) by Luke Smith. You need a theme to get started with Hugo, and lugo is a very minimal sort of tutorial theme that has enough to get you going while still being easy to rewrite to meet your needs. [See Luke's Hugo tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZFL09qhKi5I?si=2vaOCj76dAeFrmsh).

## Hosting

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), arguably the best (least limited) free static site host.
